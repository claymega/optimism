### Notes on Specific Dependencies

#### Node.js
Make sure to use the version specified in `.nvmrc`. You can use **nvm** to manage multiple versions of Node.js and automatically switch to the correct version when working on this repository.

#### Foundry
**Foundry** is updated frequently and may introduce breaking changes. This repository pins a specific version in `versions.json`. Use the command:

```sh
just update-foundry
```

to ensure your version matches the one used in CI.

#### Direnv
**Direnv** loads environment variables from `.envrc` automatically. After installing `direnv`, make sure it is hooked into your shell by following the guide on the **direnv website**. Restart your terminal or reload your config file for the changes to take effect.

#### Docker Compose
Docker Desktop includes **docker compose** by default. If you're on Linux or not using Docker Desktop, you may need to install the **Compose plugin** separately.

## Setting Up

Clone the repository and navigate to it:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
cd optimism
```

## Building the Monorepo

Before proceeding, ensure all required dependencies are installed. **Foundry** is required to build the smart contracts. Refer to the section on **Foundry** above for setup instructions.

To install dependencies and build all packages:

```sh
make build
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Packages built on one branch may not be compatible with those on a different branch. Always **rebuild** the monorepo after switching branches.

## Running Tests

### Solidity Unit Tests
```sh
cd packages/contracts-bedrock
just test
```

### Go Unit Tests
Navigate to the package you want to test and run:

```sh
go test ./...
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
For E2E tests, refer to the documentation.

### Contract Static Analysis
We use **slither** for static analysis. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed, then run:

```sh
cd packages/contracts-bedrock
pip3 install slither-analyzer
just slither
```

## Labels

- **`A-<category>`**: Defines the general area of the issue/PR.
- **`C-<category>`**: Provides contextual information about the type of change.
- **`M-<category>`**: Adds metadata about process-related aspects of the issue/PR.
- **`D-<level>`**: Indicates the difficulty level of an implementation.
- **`S-<status>`**: Specifies the current status of an issue/PR.

You can filter issues labeled **`M-community`** to find those available for external contributions:

- **Mergify bot** uses labels for automation. Ensure you update the **Mergify configuration**.
- If modifying **`S-stale`**, update the **close-stale workflow**.
- If modifying **`M-dependabot`**, update the **Dependabot config**.
- Saved label filters on project boards will **not automatically update**.
